                                                        Loan Classification

Business Problem     :      Financial institutions need to quickly and accurately decide whether to approve or deny loan applications. Manual reviews are time-consuming and prone to inconsistent judgments, which can increase default risk or slow customer service.

Predicting loan approval status using historical applicant data addresses this by providing a data-driven, standardized decision support system.

Objective: Build a model to predict loan approval (Y/N) based on applicant financial and demographic features.
Predict whether a loan application is approved or denied using applicant and loan attributes. This model helps financial institutions automate decisions and reduce credit risk.

Features

* Handles missing values and categorical encoding
* Engineers new features such as total income and EMI
* Compares multiple classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
* Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset


* Features :

  * Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self\_Employed
  * ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan\_Amount\_Term
  * Credit\_History, Property\_Area
  *Target :  Loan\_Status (Y/N)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Methodology

1. Data Cleaning:  Impute missing values (mean for numeric, mode for categorical)
2. Encoding:  Map categorical variables to numeric (label encoding and mapping)
3. Feature Engineering: Create total income and EMI features
4. Model Training: Train and tune classifiers using `GridSearchCV` (5-fold CV)
5. Evaluation: Assess models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------- | :------: | :-------: | :----: | :------: |
| Logistic Regression |   0.80   |    0.82   |  0.78  |   0.80   |
| Random Forest       |   0.84   |    0.85   |  0.82  |   0.83   |
| Gradient Boosting   |   0.86   |    0.88   |  0.84  |   0.86   |
| XGBoost (best)      |   0.87   |    0.89   |  0.85  |   0.87   |
